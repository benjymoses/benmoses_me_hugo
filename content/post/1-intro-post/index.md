## Introduction

I'm going to be blogging here as I start to play with some ideas this year, in the hope that what I create is useful for others. I've seen a number of people I respect greatly use this approach which has had 4 key results.

1. They get feedback on their ideas early, which allows them to pivot and/or iterate.

2. The community benefits from their thought process.

3. Having a collection of completed thoughts often gives rise to new ideas, and new connections between ideas.

4. Once enough ideas have come together, they're able to create a more sustantial and meaningful piece of material that gets to the essence of the topic.

## What first?

I'm undecided. But my current thought is to start with a cookie-cutter "Hello world" [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) template and see what it would take to then bake in best practices for an Enterprise business.

This idea appeals to me as it's a simple starting point from which I can add complexity over time.

## Bon voyage

Watch out for the next post as a jumping-off point.
