# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: This site is a place for me to gather my blog posts, photos, code samples and more. By day I'm a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS, based in the UK. I get to help customers adopt and make best use of technology, and learn along the way. I've always been inquisitive and have picked up lots of interesting hobbies over the years, time to share and give back. **Disclaimer** -- opinions are my own.
