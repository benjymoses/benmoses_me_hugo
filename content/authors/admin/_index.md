role: Hi, I'm **Ben**, a Principal Solutions Architect at AWS.
bio: This site is a place for me to gather my blog posts, photos, code samples
  and more. By day I'm a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS, based in the UK. I
  get to help customers adopt and make best use of technology, and learn along
  the way. I've always been inquisitive and have picked up lots of interesting
  hobbies over the years, time to share and give back. **Disclaimer** --
  opinions are my own.
